# AI Summariser Microservice

This is an in-progress microservice project built with Spring Boot, intended to support summarisation of text-based input via simple REST APIs.

## Project Goal

The microservice aims to handle both user-provided text and internally-triggered prompts, and return summaries. The service is being designed to function as a modular backend component that can be integrated into larger applications.

## Planned Features

- API endpoint to accept raw text input and return a summarised output
- Trigger-based summarisation from backend logic (no user input)
- Ready for integration with external systems
  
## Tech Stack

- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- REST APIs

## Current Status

The project is under active development.
